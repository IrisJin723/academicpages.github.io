I am a senior undergraduate student in [Psychology, Zhejiang University](http://www.psych.zju.edu.cn/), and will soon pursue a direct Ph.D. at [the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://psych.cas.cn/). My research focuses on Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Psychology, investigating human cognition and behavior to optimize human-system interactions.
